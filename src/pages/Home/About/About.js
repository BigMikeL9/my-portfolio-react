        <P>ðŸ‘‹ Hello!</P>
        <P mt={"1rem"}>
          I'm Mikel Kamel, a <span>web developer</span> who loves to bring
          people's visions to life by designing and developing websites and
          web-based applications, just like this one. I'm a Civil Engineer
          graduate from NJIT whose passion for web development has led me to
          change my career path and take on a new exciting and challenging path.
          I love creating awesome user experiences and experimenting with new
          technology to make unique websites.
        </P>

        <P mt={"2rem"}>
          Since beginning my journey as a web developer, I have created
          successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built
          with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end
          development, HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, building small and medium web
          apps, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
        </P>

        <P mt={"2rem"}>
          Here you can see some of the projects I've been working on. If you
          have any questions please feel free to contact me.
